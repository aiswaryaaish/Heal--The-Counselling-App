# Heal--The-Counselling-App

#Problem statement
Epidemiological Data analytics on health: A software or other tool to give epidemiological
health indicators-identify the biggest health issue (eg high Covid positivity rate could be
combined with high diabetics, high cancer or other comorbidity), and thereby the vulnerable
population for the local administration to act.
Idea
During this pandemic we have seen many around us are subjected to loneliness,stress, anxieties,
depressions.This was mainly due to the restrictions of movement around our home and society
and even many lost their jobs.People are forced to stay inside their homes and we can't even
travel , further interaction between people also got reduced too.As students we are struggling to
cope up with the realities of online classes which is so tiresome and this is where our inspiration
comes from.We are so interested in sorting these problems and make difference in the lives of the
people around us who are also struggling to handle this situations thereby helping them to
improve their mental status and in making them lively again.
Human psychology has always been an area of utmost wonder. A healthy mind is the core of a
healthy body. Complicated thoughts and endless emotions, most of the time drags us into
anxiety, depression and many other chaos. Moreover, COVID-19 has hit us hard causing the
graph of stress and depression to rise rapidly. Studies have shown that symptoms of anxiety and
depression has increased from 11% to 39% during the pandemic time.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many
people’s mental health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness
and substance use disorders. During the pandemic, about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported
symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder, a share that has been largely consistent, up from one
in ten adults who reported these symptoms from January to June 2019.A KFF Health Tracking
Poll from July 2020 also found that many adults are reporting specific negative impacts on their
mental health and well-being, such as difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), increases in
alcohol consumption or substance use (12%), and worsening chronic conditions (12%), due to
worry and stress over the coronavirus. As the pandemic wears on, ongoing and necessary public
health measures expose many people to experiencing situations linked to poor mental health
outcomes, such as isolation and job loss.
Consulting a psychologist or seeking help from a therapist can be of great help but again the
pandemic has closed those doors shut. Many of the times, analyzing the mental and emotional
state of the person accurately is a challenge for therapists.so we provide you with the Heal app
for counselling .we provide you with a unique feature which is Machine learning . this is what
makes us unique from others .Predicting mental health early and precisely has major implications
for clinical management and practice, and ultimately life expectancy. This project will use
machine learning techniques to produce robust modelling tools that aim to improve the precision
of clinical practice in mental health. Machine learning will be used to predict and classify disease
risk at an individual level (for dementia, anxiety, depression, and others) and to determine the
interactive factors that influence mental health across people’s lifespans (e.g. genetics, cognition,
demographics).
#Working
Our app is to help people connect with the best therapists beyond any physical restrictions.A
person can seek help from the therapist of their choice through a video meeting. They can also
choose any language according to their preference. In this modern era where AI and ML have
already touched the nook and corner of various fields, we tried to incorporate the same in our
app. During the video meeting, the mental state of the person which includes stress, anxiety,
depression and confidence levels is evaluated and displayed on the therapist's screen which
enables him to assess the person precisely. This is made possible by feeding various data sets and
developing ML/AI algorithms. Our app also provides a feature for analysing the progress of the
person with the help of level bars and day-to-day reports. A 24*7 service support is also made
available for seamless assistance.It also provides feedback and location features that enables the
user to rate the counsellor which inturn helps other users to select the counselor/therapist of a
particular location according to their choice by viewing the ratings.Slot booking facilities are
also available so that the counselor can schedule the meeting conveniently.Our app adds an
expert advice and treat the problem if the counselor loses his/her judgement.
Every meeting is recorded and the useful data from it is used to increase the accuracy of further
consultations. Over a few months, with the increase of available data set, the app will attain
95-100% accuracy. When we look ahead, we see this app turning into a perfection, constantly
providing support for millions around the world.
The uniqueness of our app is the use of machine learning to treat our users.Machine learning
algorithms could help determine key behavioral biomarkers to aid mental health professionals in
deciding if a patient is at risk of developing a particular mental health disorder. Additionally the
algorithms may assist in tracking effectiveness of a treatment plan.It comes down to every
patient having their own biology, triggers, and reactions to stress and conditions like
depression. Many of the symptoms for mental health disorders overlap and although some of the
key indicators for mental health disorders are known, a trial and error treatment plan is not
acceptable. Machine learning algorithms provide a ripe opportunity for psychiatrists and mental
health professionals to identify sub-types of different disorders and develop more catered
treatment plans and medication dosages.
#Hardware
RAM- storage space is required for the app
Software
-Flutter -
Cross-platform applications are a long-standing dream of any business, because separate native
iOS and Android apps are more expensive to develop and maintain. Flutter offers a quick way to
create visually attractive apps for both operational systems, desktop computers, and the web
from a single codebase. It is actively used and promoted by Google, and we expect that it will
become universally popular in the near future.We used flutter as our app development software.
The advantage of Flutter is not only in making one application instead of two. With this
framework, you will also have fewer problems when adapting your app to each of the platforms.
Most frameworks can cope, but that’s only if you consider them in the context of simple
applications. The real problems begin when an application becomes “overgrown” with functions
and inevitably gets complicated (it is about most products during the development stage).
-FigmaFigma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app. You can use it to do all
kinds of graphic design work from wireframing websites, designing mobile app interfaces,
prototyping designs, crafting social media posts, and everything in between. Figma is different
from other graphics editing tools.We used figma for making the prototype for the app
- Flutlab
FlutLab is a modern Flutter online IDE and the best place to create, debug, and build
cross-platform projects.We used flutlab for generating the code
Design
Simple and user-friendly design is used for building this app.We have a minimalistic design
approach in order to create a simple and highly usable mobile application.
When an application tells you how to navigate from one screen to another, it can be really
complicated for users to figure it out. Therefore, if users already know the native UI element, it
will be easy for them to follow the steps, as they will intuitively understand the application.We
use this type of native component in our app.
Implementation
Deep learning technologies are incorporated in our app so that , by continuously monitoring and
recording the sessions with the users permission, accuracy can be increased from 90-95%.
Cost
funding is required for deploying the app where we need to use the cloud storage facilities and
the cost depends on the storage requirements.
Social impact
Counselling can make a profound impact on the lives of individuals,our app helps people
navigate difficult life situations, such as the death of a loved one, divorce, natural disasters,
school stress and the loss of a job. It provides the tools and insights to manage mental health
issues, such as anxiety and depression. Ultimately, counseling empowers people to lead healthy
and fulfilling lives.It is important to realize that counseling and mental health treatment is a
healthy action for everybody. A little counseling can help everyone to improve in their everyday
life. Using our app allows you to speak your truth without filters and without pause. You never
have to worry about having others jump into your conversation or feeling as though you are
dumping a huge burden on someone. Our app acts as a support system that allows you to speak
with counselors in whatever way you need in order to find healing.
In this pandemic fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at
times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable
that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant
changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and
slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary
unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family
members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our
physical, health.Our app provides relief from these problem. anxiety disorders are the most
common mental illness in the world. They affect 40 million adults, or 18.1% of the
population, every year. Furthermore, anxiety disorders affect 25.1% of children between 13
and 18 years old, putting them at a much higher risk to perform poorly in school, engage in
substance abuse, and miss out on important social experiences. Even though this disorder is
highly treatable, only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment, most likely due to a
perceived societal stigma, with men far less likely to seek treatment. Our app help the
people who didnt receive any treatment .
Further Advancement
We would like to expand the reach of this app to remote areas and other cosmopolitan cities
through advertisements and other social awareness programmes.We have to make it more user
friendly and interesting.We have to provide an in-app search engine so as to make the search
easy and quick. The easy navigation design, the advanced search and information architecture
will all improve the usability of your app to a great extent.
Moreover, we can add animation, transitions or automation, since they 'look good' in native
mobile apps.
